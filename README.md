## Installation

Before you start, please use `pip` to install the packages `tensorflow`, `jupyter`, and `matplotlib`. We highly recommend using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable) to avoid dependency problems. Note that the current version of TensorFlow (1.3) is not compatible with older versions. Please install the newest version if you are currently running an older version.

    pip install tensorflow==1.3
    pip install jupyter
    pip install matplotlib
